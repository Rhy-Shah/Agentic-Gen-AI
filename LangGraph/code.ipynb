       "\"Page: List of unsolved problems in mathematics\\nSummary: Many mathematical problems have been stated but not yet solved. These problems come from many areas of mathematics, such as theoretical physics, computer science, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, algebraic, differential, discrete and Euclidean geometries, graph theory, group theory, model theory, number theory, set theory, Ramsey theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. Some problems belong to more than one discipline and are studied using techniques from different areas. Prizes are often awarded for the solution to a long-standing problem, and some lists of unsolved problems, such as the Millennium Prize Problems, receive considerable attention.\\nThis list is a composite of notable unsolved problems mentioned in previously published lists, including but not limited to lists considered authoritative, and the problems listed here vary widely in both difficulty and importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Tournament (graph theory)\\nSummary: In graph theory, a tournament is a directed graph with exactly one edge between each two vertices, in one of the two possible directions. Equivalently, a tournament is an orientation of an undirected complete graph. (However, as directed graphs, tournaments are not complete: complete directed graphs have two edges, in both directions, between each two vertices.) Equivalently, a tournament is a complete asymmetric relation.\\nThe name tournament comes from interpreting the graph as the outcome of a round-robin tournament, a game where each player is paired against every other exactly once. In a tournament, the vertices represent the players, and the edges between players point from the winner to the loser.\\nMany of the important properties of tournaments were investigated by H. G. Landau in 1953 to model dominance relations in flocks of chickens. Tournaments are also heavily studied in voting theory, where they can represent partial information about voter preferences among multiple candidates, and are central to the definition of Condorcet methods.\\nIf every player beats the same number of other players (indegree âˆ’ outdegree = 0) the tournament is called regular.\\n\\nPage: SHACL\\nSummary: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)  is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard language for describing Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs. SHACL has been designed to enhance the semantic and technical interoperability layers of ontologies expressed as RDF graphs.\\nSHACL models are defined in terms of constraints on the content, structure and meaning of a graph. SHACL is a highly expressive language. Among others, it includes features to express conditions that constrain the number of values that a property may have, the type of such values, numeric ranges, string matching patterns, and logical combinations of such constraints. SHACL also includes an extension mechanism to express more complex conditions in languages such as SPARQL and JavaScript. SHACL Rules add inferencing capabilities to SHACL, allowing users to define what new statements can be inferred from existing (asserted) statements.\\n\\nPage: Wikipedia\\nSummary: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that is written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.\\nInitially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages. The English Wikipedia, with over 7 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average)  as of April 2024. As of May 2025, over 25% of Wikipedia's tra\""
